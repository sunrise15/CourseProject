Smartphone Experiment: Tidy Data Set
================================

********************************
Part 1:  Background/Source
 ********************************
A series of experiments were conducted on a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 
years, to monitor various types of sensor signals based on their activities (walking, walking upstairs, 
walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying).  
The following raw data was obtained from the uci website:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

This data can be categorized into 3 categories:
-	Subject performing the activity
-	Activities performed (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying)
-	Measurement results (variables like mean or standard deviation, time or frequency signals, body or 
gravity signal, accelerator or gyroscope signal,  axial signals, jerk signals, magnitude signals)

**********************************
Part 2:  Process 
**********************************
The raw files are provided in both training and test environments.  The following procedure was 
implemented to create the tidy data set based on the raw files:
-	Read in all the measurement files.  The data are in files ./train/X_train.txt and ./test/X_text.txt.  The 
associated feature types are stored in the ./features.txt file.  Extract only the mean and standard 
deviation variables.
-	Read in activity files.  The activity codes are stored in ./train/Y_train.txt and ./test/Y_test.txt.  The 
actual mapping of each code is stored in the ./activity_labels.txt file.
-	Read in subject files.  The subjects for each measurement are stored in ./train/subject_train.txt and 
./test/subject_test.txt.
-	All 3 files have 10299 rows, one row for each observation.
-	Merge the 3 types of files together from both training and test regions as described above.
-	Appropriately assign descriptive activity names by mapping the activity file against the activity labels 
file.  Appropriately assign descriptive measurement variable names by mapping each row of the 
features file against each column of the measurement file.
-	Create an independent tidy data set with the average of each measurement variable for each 
activity and each subject.
