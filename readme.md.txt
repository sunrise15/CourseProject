Background:
************
A series of experiments were made to monitor sensor signals by a group of 30 volunteers based on their 
activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying).  A full descripton is 
available at the uci website where the raw data was obtained: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

A Tidy data set was created based on further analysis of the raw data.  Read codebook.md for further 
explanation of the data transformations.

This Repo includes the following files:

Readme.md – this document
Tidydata.txt – a tidy data set
Codebook.md – codebook that describes the variables, the data, and process of transformation from 
raw data to the tidy data set
Run_analysis.R – the R code that reads the raw data produced by the initial experiments and transforms 
it into the tidy data set
